# TLS-Twitter-Bot

This is a twitter bot built for The Last Space, an amazing writing blog by Tracy Wheatley and Kyle Turner.

This utilizes the twitter-lite, wordpress, and compromise.js libraries to pull a random post from wordpress, break the text into separate lines, then post a random line to twitter.
